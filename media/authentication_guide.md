## Installation

For Web development, regardless of framework, `aws-amplify` provides core Auth APIs
```
npm install aws-amplify
```

On React app, there are helper components in `aws-amplify-react`
```
npm install aws-amplify-react
```

In React Native development, core APIs and components are packaged into `aws-amplify-react-native`
```
npm install aws-amplify-react-native
```

## Configuration

You are required to pass in an Amazon Cognito Identity Pool ID, allowing the library to retrieve base credentials for a user even in an UnAuthenticated state. You can configure it by yourself or let [AWS Mobile Hub do it for you](#automated-setup).

Note: If using Mobile Hub, ensure that user sign-in is set to optional in your app. To do so, go your project on [AWS Mobile Hub console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/mobilehub/home.html#/) and click on your project, and then click on the **User Sign-in** tile. Verify that **Optional**
button is selected in the options for Sign-In required.

### Manual Setup

At the top of your application entry point, add in the following code to configure the library:

```
import Amplify from 'aws-amplify';

Amplify.configure({
    Auth: {
        identityPoolId: 'XX-XXXX-X:XXXXXXXX-XXXX-1234-abcd-1234567890ab', //REQUIRED - Amazon Cognito Identity Pool ID
        region: 'XX-XXXX-X', // REQUIRED - Amazon Cognito Region
        userPoolId: 'XX-XXXX-X_abcd1234', //OPTIONAL - Amazon Cognito User Pool ID
        userPoolWebClientId: 'XX-XXXX-X_abcd1234', //OPTIONAL - Amazon Cognito Web Client ID
    }
});
```

The above configuration requires an Amazon Cognito Identity Pool ID so that the library can retrieve base credentials for a user even in an UnAuthenticated state. You will also need to include Amazon Cognito User Pool ID and Web Client ID.

[Amazon Cognito User Pools](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/getting-started-with-cognito-user-pools.html)

### Automated Setup

AWS Mobile Hub streamlines the steps above for you. Simply click this button:

<p align="center">
  <a target="_blank" href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/mobilehub/home?#/?config=https://github.com/aws/aws-amplify/blob/master/media/backend/import_mobilehub/user-signin.zip">
    <span>
        <img height="100%" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/deploytomh/button-deploy-aws-mh.png"/>
    </span>
  </a>
</p>

This creates a project is fully functioning with the Auth category. After the project is created in the Mobile Hub console download the `aws-exports.js` configuration file by clicking the **Hosting and Streaming** tile then **Download aws-exports.js**.

Download `aws-exports.js` into your project source directory.

Now import the file and pass it as configuration to the Amplify library:

```
import Amplify from 'aws-amplify';
import awsmobile from './YOUR_PATH_TO_EXPORTS/aws-exports'

Amplify.configure(awsmobile});
```

## Integration

### 1. Call APIs

APIs can be used in any Javascript framework. [API Reference](api_reference.md) has full list. Below are some examples to get started.

#### Sign In
```
import { Auth } from 'aws-amplify';

Auth.signIn(username, password)
    .then(data => console.log(data))
    .catch(err => console.log(err));
```

#### Sign Up
```
import { Auth } from 'aws-amplify';

Auth.signUp(username, password, email, phone)
    .then(data => console.log(data))
    .catch(err => console.log(err));
```

#### Sign Out
```
import { Auth } from 'aws-amplify';

Auth.signOut()
    .then(data => console.log(data))
    .catch(err => console.log(err));
```

### 2. withAuthenticator HOC

For React app, then simpliest way to add Auth flows into your app is to use `withAuthenticator`.

Just add these two lines to your `App.js`:

```
import { withAuthenticator } from 'aws-amplify-react';

...

export default withAuthenticator(App);
```

Now your app is guarded by complete Auth flow. Only signed in user can access the app.

#### Sign Out Button

The default `withAuthenticator` renders just the App component after a user is signed in, preventing interference with your app. Then question comes, how does the user sign out?

To expose this, set the second parameter to true, which means `includeGreetings = true`. It will put a greeting row on top of your app.

```
export default withAuthenticator(App, true);
```

### 3. Authenticate Component

The `withAuthenticator` HOC essentially just wraps `Authenticator` component. You can use the `Authenticator` directly to give yourself more customization options.

#### Example: Put App inside Authenticator

App.js
```
import { Authenticator } from 'aws-amplify-react';

...

class AppWithAuth extends Component {
  render(){
    return (
      <div>
      <Authenticator>
        <App />
      </Authenticator>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default AppWithAuth;
```

#### Example: Only show App when signed in

In the above example you'll see the App rendered even before the user is signed in. This is easy to change.

When inside `Authenticator`, the App component will get a few properties.

* authState - current authentication state, signIn | signUp | confirmSignIn | confirmSignUp | forgotPassword | verifyContact | signedIn
* authData - additional data to the authState, when signedIn it is an user object
* onStateChange - callback function, for what's inside `Authenticator` to notify authState changes.

With that, to control when to render App component, simply add the following line to the `render()` method of the `App` component:
```
    render() {
        if (this.props.authState !== 'signedIn') { return null; }
    ...
```

### 4. Compose Authenticator

`Authenticator` is designed as a container, which contains a number of Auth components. Each component does one job, for example SignIn, SignUp etc.

You can compose your own Authenticator, but you must set `hideDefault={true}`.

For example, this Authenticator only shows Greetings component which has a Sign Out button:

```
    <Authenticator hideDefault={true}>
        <Greetings />
    </Authenticator>
```

#### Greeting message

The Greetings component has messages for two different auth states: signedIn, and signedOut. To customize the messages, set properties `signedInMessage` and `signedOutMessage` using a string or function.

```
    <Authenticator hideDefault={true}>
        <Greetings
            signedInMessage={(username) => 'Hello ' + username}
            signedOutMessage="Come back"
        />
    </Authenticator>
```

### 5. Write Your Own Auth UI

You may write your own Auth UI. JTo do this your component will leverage the following properties:

* authState
* authData
* onStateChange

This example creates an `AlwaysOn` Auth UI, which shows the current auth state.

```
import { Authenticator, SignIn, SignOut, ConfirmSignUp, Greetings } from 'aws-amplify-reactâ€™;

const AlwaysOn = (props) => {
    return (
        <div>
            <div>I am always here to show current auth state: {this.props.authState}</div>
            <button onClick={() => this.props.onStateChange('signUp')}>Show Sign Up</button>
        </div>
    )
}

handleAuthStateChange(state) {
    if (state === 'signedIn') { /* GO TO Main Page */ }
}

render() {
    return (
        <Authenticator hideDefault={true} onStateChange={this.handleAuthStateChange}>
            <SignIn/>
            <SignUp/>
            <ConfirmSignUp/>
            <Greetings/>
            <AlwaysOn/>
        </Authenticator>
    )
}
```

## Extensions

### Component Styling

Amplify UI components are theme based. Check the `AmplifyTheme.js` file for default styling.

You may want to create your own theme, and then pass to Amplify components.

```
import MyTheme from './MyTheme';

<Authenticator theme={MyTheme} />
```

Alternatively, override `AmplifyTheme`:

```
import { AmplifyTheme } from 'aws-amplify-react';

const MySectionHeader = Object.assign({}, AmplifyTheme.sectionHeader, { background: 'orange' });
const MyTheme = Object.assign({}, AmplifyTheme, { sectionHeader: MySectionHeader });

<Authenticator theme={MyTheme} />
```

### Error Message

During authentication flows, there are some error messages returned from server. Amplify provides a simple way of customizing error messages with a `messageMap` callback.

The function simply takes the original message as arguments and then outputs the desired message. Check `AmplifyMessageMap.js` to see how Amplify makes the map function.

```
const map = (message) => {
    if (/incorrect.*username.*password/i.test(message)) {
        return 'Incorrect username or password';
    }

    return message;
}

<Authenticator errorMessage={map} />
```

You may notice in `AmplifyMessageMap.js` it also handles intenationalization. The topic is covered in [I18n Guide](i18n_guide.md)
