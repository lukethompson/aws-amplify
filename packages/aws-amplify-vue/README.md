# AWS Amplify Package - aws-amplify-vue

The ```aws-amplify-vue``` package is a set of Vue components which integrates your Vue application with the AWS-Amplify library.

It is intended for use with Vue applications using version 2.5 or above, and was created using the Vue 3.0 CLI.

## Setup 

In your Vue app, install the following:

```
npm i aws-amplify aws-amplify-vue
```

Then, alter main.js:

```
import * as AmplifyModules from 'aws-amplify';
import * as AmplifyVue from 'aws-amplify-vue';
import aws_exports from './aws-exports';
Amplify.configure(aws_exports)

Vue.use(AmplifyVue.plugins.amplifyPlugin, {AmplifyModules});

// It's important that you instantiate the Vue instance after calling Vue.use!

new Vue({
  render: h => h(App)
}).$mount('#app')

```

In App.vue:

```
<script>
import { components } from 'aws-amplify-vue'

export default {
  name: 'app', 
  components: {
    ...<yourOtherComponents>,
    ...components
  }
}
</script>

```

## AmplifyEventBus

The aws-amplify-vue package implments a Vue EventBus for emitting and listening to events within it's components.  The events emmitted by the components are listed within the documentation for each individual component.

To listen to these events within one of your components, import the EventBus:
```
import { AmplifyEventBus } from 'aws-amplify-vue';
```

Then, register an event listener (potentially within a lifecycle hook):
```
AmplifyEventBus.$on('authState', info => {
  console.log(`Here is the auth event that was just emitted by an Amplify component: ${info}`)
});
```

## AmplifyPlugin

The aws-amplify-vue package provides a Vue plugin to access the Amplify library.  You installed the plugin when you set up your application:

```Vue.use(AmplifyVue.plugins.amplifyPlugin, {AmplifyModules})```

This makes the Amplify library available to the aws-amplify-vue components as well as to your application.  Please note that you can restict the modules that are made available to the plugin by passing only specific modules in the second argument of ```Vue.use``` call.

### Using the AmplifyPlugin

To call the Amplify library, simply use ``this.$Amplify.`` followed by whichever module you wish to use.
