# Bugs

Bug reports and feature suggestions are welcome. When filing a bug, try to include as much information as you can. Details like these are incredibly useful:

* A reproducible test case or series of steps
* The date/commit of the code you're running
* Any modifications you've made relevant to the bug
* Anything unusual about your environment or deployment

# Pull Requests

Pull requests are welcome!

You should open an issue to discuss your pull request, unless it's a trivial change. It's best to ensure that your proposed change would be accepted so that you don't waste your own time.

Pull requests should generally be opened against **master**.

## Tests

Please ensure that your change still passes unit tests, and ideally integration/UI tests. It's OK if you're still working on tests at the time that you submit, but be prepared to be asked about them.

## Code Style

Generally, match the style of the surrounding code. We ship an EditorConfig file for indentation and TSLint configuration for TypeScript code. Please ensure your changes don't wildly deviate from those rules. You can run `npm run lint` to identify and automatically fix most style issues.
